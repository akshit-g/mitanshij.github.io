# *Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Software Version Control Project*

## *Project Overview*
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is hosted on GitHub Pages, and the source code is managed through GitHub using best practices for version control. This repository demonstrates the use of Git commands like fork, branch, pull requests (PR), merge, and rollback.

## *Team Members*
- *A*: Pages and frontend development.
- *M*: Repository setup, deployment, and code reviews.
- *S*: Game logic and functionality.

## *Technologies Used*
- *HTML*: For structuring the web page.
- *CSS*: For styling the game board and interface.
- *JavaScript*: For game logic and interactivity.

## *Objective*
The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of software version control principles through Git and GitHub. The following tasks were completed:
- Forking and cloning repositories.
- Creating and merging feature branches.
- Raising and reviewing pull requests (PRs).
- Demonstrating a rollback action.
- Deploying the project on GitHub Pages.

## *Git Workflow*
1. *Forking and Cloning*:
   Each team member forked the repository to their personal GitHub accounts, then cloned it locally to work on their assigned tasks.

2. *Branching*:
   - *A* worked on the pages branch, which contains the HTML, CSS, and JS files for the game.
   - *S* worked on the game-files branch, which contains the game logic and assets.

3. *Pull Requests (PRs)*:
   Once the tasks were completed on the respective branches, *A* and *S* created pull requests to merge their changes into the main branch. *M* reviewed and merged the pull requests.

4. *Code Review*:
   *M* reviewed the code to ensure that everything was working correctly, followed best practices, and that the game functioned as expected.

5. *Rollback*:
   In case of any issues or errors, *M* demonstrated the use of rollback by reverting to a previous working commit using git revert.

6. *Deployment*:
   *M* deployed the project on GitHub Pages by setting the appropriate branch for hosting.
